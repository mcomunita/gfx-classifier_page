                Applications of deep learning to automatic multitrack mixing are largely unexplored. 
                This is partly due to the limited available data, coupled with the fact that such data is relatively unstructured and variable. 
                To address these challenges, we propose a domain-inspired model with a strong inductive bias for the mixing task. 
                We achieve this with the application of pre-trained sub-networks and weight sharing, as well as with a sum/difference stereo loss function. 
                The proposed model can be trained with a limited number of examples, is permutation invariant with respect to the input ordering, 
                and places no limit on the number of input sources. 
                Furthermore, it produces human-readable mixing parameters, allowing users to manually adjust or refine the generated mix. 
                Results from a perceptual evaluation involving audio engineers indicate that our approach generates mixes that outperform baseline approaches. 
                To the best of our knowledge, this work demonstrates the first approach in learning multitrack mixing conventions from real-world data at the waveform level, 
                without knowledge of the underlying mixing parameters.

                    <p>The transformation network is tasked with emulating a series connection of digital audio effects. 
                        In this case we train the transformation network to model an EQ, dynamic range compressor, and reverb. 
                        To train this network we randomly configure the parameters of the signal chain, and process clean examples
                        from the dataset to generate input and target pairs. 
                        In the samples below, we shown the input signal and the target signal from the original signal chain with a number of random configurations,
                        where EQ, compression, and reverb are all applied.  
                        The remaining examples are the output of three trained models, TCN-10, TCN-20, and TCN-30. 
                        All examples here come from the test set of the <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3824876">SignalTrain LA2A Dataset</a>.

                        After training the transformation network, we use the pre-trained weights from this model, 
                        along with the encoder to build the differentiable mixing console (DMC). 
                        Weights are shared across the input channels for these models, along with the post-processor.
                        Here we show examples generated from songs in the test sets of the ENST-Drums and MedleyDB datasets.
                        Our DMC model is compared against the mono mix and random mix baselines, as well as an adaptation of Demucs.
                        We also include here the boxplots showing the results from a perceptual evaluation involving 16 audio engineers.
                        They were asked to listen to the same passages shown below, and provide a rating for each on a scale from 0 and 1.

                        By processing audio signals in the time-domain with randomly weighted temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), 
                        we uncover a wide range of novel, yet controllable overdrive effects. We discover that architectural aspects, 
                        such as the depth of the network, the kernel size, the number of channels, the activation function, 
                        as well as the weight initialization, all have a clear impact on the sonic character of the resultant effect, 
                        without the need for training. 
                        In practice, these effects range from conventional overdrive and distortion, 
                        to more extreme effects, as the receptive field grows, similar to a fusion of distortion, equalization, delay, and reverb. 
                        To enable use by musicians and producers, we provide a real-time plugin implementation. 
                        This allows users to dynamically design networks, listening to the results in real-time.

                        Adding reverberation to musical sources is an essential part of creating an engaging listening experience. 
                        NeuralReverberator is a convolutional reverb synthesizer that uses a spectral autoencoder as a generative model. 
                        We implement the model as a real-time plugin that allows audio engineers to traverse the latent space of the autoencoder,
                        and generate novel reverberation effect with varying timbre and duration.

                        We use a disentangled variational autoencoder (β-VAE) in order to provide a new modality for modifying the timbre of recordings via a parametric equalizer. 
                        By traversing the learned latent space of the trained decoder network in the real-time plugin, 
                        the user can more quickly search through the configurations of a five band parametric equalizer. 
                        This methodology promotes using one’s ears to determine the proper EQ settings over looking at transfer functions or specific frequency controls.
